# Simple Neural Networks in Python
Bare bones neural networks in Python for learning and experimentation

A set of simple, working neural network examples with enough comments to show how they work. 

The examples started out as the code here, which is well worth a read first:

## Requirements

Python3 and numpy

`pip install numpy`

Also one of the examples uses [PygameZero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to draw graphs.
